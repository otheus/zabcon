Bandwidth reports for Zabbix

This has been tested to work with 1.6.x

Before you install this script there are a few things you must do.

First you will need the following ruby gems installed

active record
ruport
tmail

You will also need to edit the mysql_parts.sql file.  Specificially you will need to edit
the mysql view that get's created at the bottom.  There is a string used that looks similar to
"ifinoctets" and "ifoutoctets".  You will need to chagne this string to match how you have
your interface items set.  The % character is a wildcard character.

There is also a statement that looks similar to this:
substr(`items`.`description`,11)

You will need to change the number to match the start of the port number in 
the description string.  For example if your descriptions look similar to 
this:  "Inbound 01" you would change the statement to look like the 
following: substr(`items`.`description`,9).  If your description string looked
like the following: "Interface 01 Inbound" you would change the statement to 
look as follows: substr(`items`.`description`,11,2).  You will need to adjust 
this statement for both inbound and outbound description types.

After that add the mysql components to your db by doing somethign similar to 
the following:

cat mysql_parts | mysql zabbix
(you may need to alter this statement to fit your environment)
